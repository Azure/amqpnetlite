## AmqpNetLite C# Examples
This directory contains example C# programs using the library. Some of the examples require an AMQP 1.0 broker with pre-configured queues. The examples are organized as follows:
* Device: examples for NETMF and Windows Phone.
* Interop: clients interoperating with a broker in different patterns.
* Listener: usage of the listener APIs in server or broker applications.
* PeerToPeer: peer-to-peer communication.
* ServiceBus: clients interoperating with the Azure Service Bus service.

### Device Examples
| Project | Description |
|---------|:-----------|
| Device.Controller | A Windows Phone 8.0 app that reads temprature data from a "data" queue and sends commands to a "control" queue to adjust the temprature. |
| Device.Controller2 | Same as Device.Controller but for Windows Phone 8.1. |
| Device.Thermometer | A NETMF app that displays current temprature, sends it to a "data" queue, and reads commands from a "control" queue to change the temprature. |
| Device.SmallMemory | A NETMF app that uses the Amqp.Micro.NetMF client to send and receive data to the Azure IoT Hub service. |

### Interop Examples
| Project | Description |
|---------|:-----------|
| Interop.Client | A request-response client |
| Interop.Server | A request-response server |
| Interop.Spout | A message sender client |
| Interop.Drain | A message receiver client |

### Listener Examples
| Project | Description |
|---------|:-----------|
| Listener.ContainerHost | Usage of ILinkProcessor and LinkEndpoint |
| Listener.IContainer | Usage of IContainer to build a fully functional AMQP 1.0 broker |

### PeerToPeer Examples
| Project | Description |
|---------|:-----------|
| PeerToPeer.Client | A client sending requests to remote peer and receiving responses |
| PeerToPeer.Server | A listener replying to client requests. The client and server examples also demonstrate recovery from connection failures. |
| PeerToPeer.Receiver | A receiver reading CPU and memory data from an monitoring endpoint registered with a container host. |
| PeerToPeer.Certificate | Mutual authentication of the client (a message sender) and the listener using X509 certificates. |
| PeerToPeer.CustomType | Usage of the built-in serializer to send .Net objects to remote peer (or even a broker). |

### ServiceBus Examples
| Project | Description |
|---------|:-----------|
| ServiceBus.EventHub | Sending to Event Hub with and without partition key, partition and publisher; receiving from partitions. Mapping of AMQP message to EventData. |
| ServiceBus.EventHub.NetMF | Interacting with Event Hubs service on NETMF. |
| ServiceBus.Cbs | Authentication with CBS (Claim Based Security) |
| ServiceBus.MessageSession | Working with MessageSession in Service Bus |
| ServiceBus.Topic | Working with Topic and Subscription in Service Bus |
