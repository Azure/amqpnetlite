## Getting Started
* [Articles and API Documentation](http://azure.github.io/amqpnetlite/)
* [Examples](https://github.com/Azure/amqpnetlite/tree/master/Examples) Please take a minute to look at the examples.
* [.Net Core](https://github.com/Azure/amqpnetlite/tree/master/dotnet) If you are looking for information about using amqpnetlite on .Net Core (coreclr, dnxcore50, etc.), your can find the code and a Hello AMQP! example here.
* Interested in the code?  
  * Prerequisites:  
    * Visual Studio 2013 (e.g. Community Edition), and optionally  
    * NETMF SDK (4.2-4.4) and Visual Studio project system  
    * Application Builder for Windows Embedded Compact 2013  
    * dotnet/cli for building and testing dotnet projects  
    * NuGet tools if you want to build the NuGet package  
  * If you don't have netmf, netcf, dotnet/cli installed, you can still build the .Net projects in Visual Studio.  
  * To run the build.cmd script to do a full build and test, you need all the prerequisites.
